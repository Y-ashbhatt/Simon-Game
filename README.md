# [Simon-Game](https://y-ashbhatt.github.io/Simon-Game/)
 Made the Simon-Game Using JQuery
 
From this code, I learned:

1. Event Handling: Detecting user actions with keypress and click events.


2. Game Logic: Generating random sequences and comparing user input using nextSequence() and checkAnswer().


3. State Management: Managing game state with variables like started, gamePattern, and level.


4. DOM Manipulation: Using jQuery to update the HTML and animate buttons.


5. Audio/Animation: Playing sounds and adding visual effects with playSound() and animatePress().


6. Error Handling: Restarting the game when the user makes a mistake with startOver().



This taught me how to build interactive games with JavaScript and jQuery.
